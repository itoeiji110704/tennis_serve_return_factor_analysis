# tennis_serve_return_factor_analysis

This repo is a factor analysis that serve strength and return strength for pro-tennis players.  
It looks like there are some player who is good at serve and some player who is good at return in pro-tennis players.  
So I assume that each pro-tennis player has a latent variable for serve and return strength, which estimated by factor analysis and tried to quantify the serve and return strength of each player.  
  
See `notebooks/analysis_serve_return_strength.ipynb`
